/**
 * Configure CedarJS Realtime
 *
 * See https://cedarjs.com/docs/realtime
 *
 * Realtime supports Live Queries and Subscriptions over GraphQL SSE.
 *
 * Live Queries are GraphQL queries that are automatically re-run when the data they depend on changes.
 *
 * Subscriptions are GraphQL queries that are run when a client subscribes to a channel.
 *
 * Redwood Realtime
 *  - uses a publish/subscribe model to broadcast data to clients.
 *  - uses a store to persist Live Query and Subscription data.
 *
 * Redwood Realtime supports in-memory and Redis stores:
 * - In-memory stores are useful for development and testing.
 * - Redis stores are useful for production.
